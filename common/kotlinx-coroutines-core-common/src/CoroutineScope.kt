 * Creates new [CoroutineScope] and calls the specified suspend block with this scope.
 * The provided scope inherits its [coroutineContext][CoroutineScope.coroutineContext] from the outer scope, but overrides
 * context's [Job].
 *
 * This methods returns as soon as given block and all launched from within the scope children coroutines are completed.
 * Example of the scope usages looks like this:
 *
 * ```
 * suspend fun loadDataForUI() = coroutineScope {
 *
 *   val data = async { // <- extension on current scope
 *      ... load some UI data ...
 *   }
 *
 *   withContext(UI) { // <- extension on current scope
 *     doSomeWork()
 *     val result = data.await()
 *     display(result)
 *   }
 *
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Semantics of the scope in this example:
 * 1) `loadDataForUI` returns as soon as data is loaded and UI is updated
 * 2) If `doSomeWork` throws an exception, then `async` task will be cancelled and `loadDataForUI` will rethrow that exception
 * 3) If outer scope of `loadDataForUI` is cancelled, both started `async` and `withContext` will be cancelled
 *
 * Method may throw [JobCancellationException] if job was cancelled externally or corresponding unhandled [Throwable] if scope has any.
